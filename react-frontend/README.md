# React Learning Project

## Overview

This project was undertaken as part of my learning journey in React. It's a simple web application that demonstrates basic React functionalities including routing, state management, and interaction with a backend server. The application includes four main pages:

- **Homepage:** The starting point of the application.
- **Login Page:** Allows users to log in.
- **Register Page:** Enables new users to register.
- **Welcome Page:** A welcome screen that users see after successfully logging in.

The application is designed to work with a local backend server running on `localhost:3000`.
